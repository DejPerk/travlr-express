Travlr Getaways is a full stack travel booking application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). It includes a customer facing site and an admin SPA with JWT based login authentication.

Architecture

The customer site uses Express with Handlebars for server rendered pages, while the admin side uses an Angular SPA for dynamic trip management. MongoDB was chosen for its flexible document based structure and seamless integration with Node and Express.

Functionality

JSON is used to transfer data between the frontend and backend, while JavaScript handles application logic. Code was refactored to use reusable Angular components and services, improving efficiency and maintainability.

Testing

API endpoints were tested using Postman for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Protected routes were tested with JWT tokens to confirm secure admin only access.

Reflection

This course helped me build a complete full stack application and strengthened my skills in Angular, REST APIs, databases, and authentication, making me more confident as a software developer.
